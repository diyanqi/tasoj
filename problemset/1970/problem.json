Since both are super-intelligent teenage girls, they&rsquo;ve always been trying to solve their disputes in a peaceful and nonviolent way. After god knows how many different challenges they&rsquo;ve given to one another, their score is equal and they&rsquo;re both desperately trying to best the other in various games of wits. This time, Dexterina challenged Womandark to a game of Nim.</p><p>Nim is a two-player game in which players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects from a single heap. The player who can't make a turn loses. By their agreement, the sizes of piles are selected randomly from the range <span class=\"tex-span\">[0,<i>x</i>]</span>. Each pile's size is taken independently from the same probability distribution that is known before the start of the game.</p><p>Womandark is coming up with a brand new and evil idea on how to thwart Dexterina&rsquo;s plans, so she hasn&rsquo;t got much spare time. She, however, offered you some tips on looking fabulous in exchange for helping her win in Nim. Your task is to tell her what is the probability that the first player to play wins, given the rules as above.</p></div><div class=\"input-specification\"><div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line of the input contains two integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1&le;<i>n</i>&le;10<sup class=\"upper-index\">9</sup></span>) and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1&le;<i>x</i>&le;100</span>)&minus; the number of heaps and the maximum number of objects in a heap, respectively. The second line contains <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>x</i>+1</span> real numbers, given with up to <span class=\"tex-span\">6</span> decimal places each: <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>P</i>(0),<i>P</i>(1),... ,<i>P</i>(<i>X</i>)</span>. Here, <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>P</i>(<i>i</i>)</span> is the probability of a heap having exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span> objects in start of a game. It's guaranteed that the sum of all <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>P</i>(<i>i</i>)</span> is equal to <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>.</p></div><div class=\"output-specification\"><div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>Output a single real number, the probability that the first player wins.
