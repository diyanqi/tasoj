If Bob had such a stick, he sold it and got <span class=\"tex-span\">2<sup class=\"upper-index\"><i>x</i></sup></span> berllars. </li><li> Bob won some programming competition and got a <span class=\"tex-span\">2<sup class=\"upper-index\"><i>x</i></sup></span> MB memory stick as a prize. Bob could choose whether to present this memory stick to one of his friends, or keep it. </li></ul><p>Bob never kept more than one memory stick, as he feared to mix up their capacities, and deceive a customer unintentionally. It is also known that for each memory stick capacity there was at most one customer, who wanted to buy that memory stick. Now, knowing all the customers' demands and all the prizes won at programming competitions during the last <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> days, Bob wants to know, how much money he could have earned, if he had acted optimally.</p></div><div class=\"input-specification\"><div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first input line contains number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1&le;<i>n</i>&le;5000</span>) &minus; amount of Bob's working days.
