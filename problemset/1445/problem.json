One day a problem called \"Flags\" from a website called Timmy's Online Judge caught his attention. In the problem one had to find the number of three-colored flags that would satisfy the condition... actually, it doesn't matter. Igor K. quickly found the formula and got the so passionately desired Accepted.</p><p>However, the professor wasn't very much impressed. He decided that the problem represented on Timmy's Online Judge was very dull and simple: it only had three possible colors of flag stripes and only two limitations. He suggested a complicated task to Igor K. and the fellow failed to solve it. Of course, we won't tell anybody that the professor couldn't solve it as well.</p><p>And how about you? Can you solve the problem?</p><p>The flags consist of one or several parallel stripes of similar width. The stripes can be one of the following colors: white, black, red or yellow. You should find the number of different flags with the number of stripes from <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>L</i></span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>R</i></span>, if:</p><ul> <li> a flag cannot have adjacent stripes of one color; </li><li> a flag cannot have adjacent white and yellow stripes; </li><li> a flag cannot have adjacent red and black stripes; </li><li> a flag cannot have the combination of black, white and red stripes following one after another in this or reverse order; </li><li> symmetrical flags (as, for example, a WB and a BW flag, where W and B stand for the white and black colors) are considered the same. </li></ul></div><div class=\"input-specification\"><div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The only line contains two integers <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>L</i></span> and <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>R</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1&le;<i>L</i>&le;<i>R</i>&le;10<sup class=\"upper-index\">9</sup></span>).
