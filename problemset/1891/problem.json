There will be <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.</p><p>Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">differs by no more than one</span> from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.</p><p>Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used).
