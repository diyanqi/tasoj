He has <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> distinct pairs of socks which are initially in a bag. The pairs are numbered from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>. Andryusha wants to put paired socks together and put them in the wardrobe. He takes the socks one by one from the bag, and for each sock he looks whether the pair of this sock has been already took out of the bag, or not. If not (that means the pair of this sock is still in the bag), he puts the current socks on the table in front of him. Otherwise, he puts both socks from the pair to the wardrobe.</p><p>Andryusha remembers the order in which he took the socks from the bag.

Then he took the next sock which is from the first pair as well, so he immediately puts both socks to the wardrobe. Thus, at most one sock was on the table at the same time.</p><p>In the second example Andryusha behaved as follows: </p><ul> <li> Initially the table was empty, he took out a sock from pair <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> and put it on the table. </li><li> Sock <span class=\"tex-span\">(2)</span> was on the table. Andryusha took out a sock from pair <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> and put it on the table. </li><li> Socks <span class=\"tex-span\">(1,2)</span> were on the table. Andryusha took out a sock from pair <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>, and put this pair into the wardrobe. </li><li> Sock <span class=\"tex-span\">(2)</span> was on the table. Andryusha took out a sock from pair <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span> and put it on the table. </li><li> Socks <span class=\"tex-span\">(2,3)</span> were on the table.
