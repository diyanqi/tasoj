This time the Beaver invites the contest participants to check out a problem on sorting documents by their subjects. Let's describe the problem:</p><p>You've got some training set of documents. For each document you know its subject. The subject in this problem is an integer from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span>. Each of these numbers has a physical meaning. For instance, all documents with subject <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span> are about trade.</p><p>You can download the training set of documents at the following link: <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">http://download4.abbyy.com/a2/X2RZ2ZWXBG5VYWAL61H76ZQM/train.zip</span>. The archive contains three directories with names \"1\", \"2\", \"3\". Directory named \"1\" contains documents on the <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>-st subject, directory \"2\" contains documents on the <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span>-nd subject, and directory \"3\" contains documents on the <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span>-rd subject. Each document corresponds to exactly one file from some directory.</p><p>All documents have the following format: the first line contains the document identifier, the second line contains the name of the document, all subsequent lines contain the text of the document. The document identifier is used to make installing the problem more convenient and has no useful information for the participants.</p><p>You need to write a program that should indicate the subject for a given document. It is guaranteed that all documents given as input to your program correspond to one of the three subjects of the training set.</p></div><div class=\"input-specification\"><div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>id</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">0&le;<i>id</i>&le;10<sup class=\"upper-index\">6</sup></span>) &minus; the document identifier. The second line contains the name of the document. The third and the subsequent lines contain the text of the document. It is guaranteed that the size of any given document will not exceed <span class=\"tex-span\">10</span> kilobytes.</p><p>The tests for this problem are divided into <span class=\"tex-span\">10</span> groups. Documents of groups <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> and <span class=\"tex-span\">2</span> are taken from the training set, but their identifiers will not match the identifiers specified in the training set. Groups from the <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span>-rd to the <span class=\"tex-span\">10</span>-th are roughly sorted by the author in ascending order of difficulty (these groups contain documents which aren't present in the training set).</p></div><div class=\"output-specification\"><div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>Print an integer from <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span> to <span class=\"tex-span\">3</span>, inclusive &minus; the number of the subject the given document corresponds to.</p></div><div class=\"sample-tests\"><div class=\"section-title\">Examples</div><div class=\"sample-test\"></div></div></div></div>\n"}, "tags": ["Codeforces"], "input_description": {"format": "html", "value": ""}, "output_description": {"format": "html", "value": ""}, "test_case_score": [{"score": 10, "input_name": "1.in", "output_name": "1.out"}], "hint": {"format": "html", "value": ""}, "time_limit": 2000, "memory_limit": 256, "samples": [{"input": "", "output": ""}], "template": {}, "spj": null, "rule_type": "OI", "source": "", "answers": [{"language": "Python3", "code": "print('Hello, world!')"}]}
