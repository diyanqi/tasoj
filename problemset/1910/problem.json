Sereja coaches his teams for a number of year and he knows that to get ready for the training session it's not enough to prepare only problems and editorial. As the training sessions lasts for several hours, teams become hungry. Thus, Sereja orders a number of pizzas so they can eat right after the end of the competition.</p><p>Teams plan to train for <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> times during <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> consecutive days. During the training session Sereja orders exactly one pizza for each team that is present this day.

The first discount works if one buys two pizzas at one day, while the second is a coupon that allows to buy one pizza during two <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">consecutive</span> days (two pizzas in total).</p><p>As Sereja orders really a lot of pizza at this place, he is the golden client and can use the unlimited number of discounts and coupons of any type at any days.</p><p>Sereja wants to order exactly <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>a</i><sub class=\"lower-index\"><i>i</i></sub></span> pizzas on the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>i</i></span>-th day while using only discounts and coupons.
