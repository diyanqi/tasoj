It is not a surprise that today Olga fell asleep on the Literature. She had a dream in which she was on a stairs. </p><p>The stairs consists of <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> steps. The steps are numbered from bottom to top, it means that the lowest step has number <span class=\"tex-span\">1</span>, and the highest step has number <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>. Above each of them there is a pointer with the direction (up or down) Olga should move from this step. As soon as Olga goes to the next step, the direction of the pointer (above the step she leaves) changes. It means that the direction \"up\" changes to \"down\", the direction \"down\" &minus; to the direction \"up\".</p><p>Olga always moves to the next step in the direction which is shown on the pointer above the step. </p><p>If Olga moves beyond the stairs, she will fall and wake up. Moving beyond the stairs is a moving down from the first step or moving up from the last one (it means the <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>-th) step. </p><p>In one second Olga moves one step up or down according to the direction of the pointer which is located above the step on which Olga had been at the beginning of the second. </p><p>For each step find the duration of the dream if Olga was at this step at the beginning of the dream.</p><p>Olga's fall also takes one second, so if she was on the first step and went down, she would wake up in the next second.</p></div><div class=\"input-specification\"><div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains single integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1&le;<i>n</i>&le;10<sup class=\"upper-index\">6</sup></span>)&minus; the number of steps on the stairs.</p><p>The second line contains a string <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>s</i></span> with the length <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span>&minus; it denotes the initial direction of pointers on the stairs.
