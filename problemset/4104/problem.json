Petr's got a very tight schedule and for each day of the week he knows how many pages he will be able to read on that day. Some days are so busy that Petr will have no time to read whatsoever. However, we know that he will be able to read at least one page a week.</p><p>Assuming that Petr will not skip days and will read as much as he can every day, determine on which day of the week he will read the last page of the book.</p></div><div class=\"input-specification\"><div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first input line contains the single integer <span class=\"tex-span\"><i>n</i></span> (<span class=\"tex-span\">1&le;<i>n</i>&le;1000</span>) &minus; the number of pages in the book.</p><p>The second line contains seven non-negative space-separated integers that do not exceed <span class=\"tex-span\">1000</span> &minus; those integers represent how many pages Petr can read on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday correspondingly.
